# Court & Field Reservation System
###Overview
This is a simple Client-Server Java application for reserving sports courts and fields.
The system allows multiple users to connect, register, and make reservations for different sports entirely through the console — no GUI required.

It was built as part of our Network Programming Lab (IT328) project to practice using sockets, multi-threading, and basic synchronization in Java.

###Features
✅ Multi-Client Support — multiple users can connect to the server at the same time
✅ Registration System — users register with a username and password (no hashing for simplicity)
✅ Thread Safety — synchronized sections prevent duplicate usernames
✅ Console Interaction — all user interaction happens through the command line
✅ Extensible Structure — future versions will include sport selection and time slot reservations
